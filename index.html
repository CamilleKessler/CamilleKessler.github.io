								<p>On 10 September 2023, my supervisor and I embarked on a long journey to the 
									French archipelago of Saint-Pierre et Miquelon, off the coast of Newfoundland, 
									for a community outreach project.
									White-tailed deer were introduced on Miquelon in the 50's with a small
									number of founder individuals. The authorities were worried that inbreeding might be causing phenotypic
									defects in the populations as deer on the island presents a high frequency of leucism, a coat colour 
									abnormality, and of malloclusions, a jaw deformity where the lower jaw is shorter than the upper jaw. 
									They mandated Prof. Aaron Shafer to carry out genomic analyses in order to estimate the inbreeding within the 
									population and find the reason for the high frequencies of such unusual deer on Miquelon.
									The project was carried out by Brookly Cars for her undergraduate honours thesis which I co-supervised, and as the only fluent 
									French speaker on the team, I was responsible for presenting the results to the SPM community.</p>
								<a class="image"></a><img src="images/SPM_paysage.jpeg" style="float: left; width: 40%; height: 40%; padding: 1%;"
									alt=""/></a>
								<p>We arrived on a gloomy day (they would all be gloomy), and we had two presentations
									scheduled for our short stay. The first was to take place the same evening in Saint-Pierre, after
									the very first TV AND radio interviews of my life, both surprise interviews for which I felt hopelessly 
									unprepared. Needless to say that my impostor syndrome kicked in hard. 
									We left early the next day to take the ferry for Miquelon where we had the chance to 
									tour the island and hike, we saw some deer including nursing twins which were absolutely adorable. The 
									second presentation took place that night with very few people who nevertheless showed great interest in
									what we had to say. In short, that the high frequency of unsual traits in SPM deer were not caused by 
									inbreeding and that the population was not at risk on the genomic level, you can learn more 
									<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.01.551454">here</a>.</p>
								<p>We went back to Saint-Pierre the next morning and left the archipelago the day after.
									Travelling to Saint-Pierre et Miquelon was never something I had imagined I would do, you don't wake up one
									day and think "Ouh I want to go there!". I'm sure many people hadn't heard about the place before the last season of
									Peaky Blinders so I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to go on such a fun and interesting trip.

							<p>The glacial cycles of the Quaternary heavily impacted species through successions of 
								population contractions and expansions. Similarly, population demography has been 
								intensely shaped by human pressures such as unregulated hunting and land use changes. 
								White-tailed and mule deer survived in different refugia through the Last Glacial 
								Maximum, and their populations were severely reduced after the European colonisation. 
								Here, we analysed 73 re-sequenced deer genomes form across their North American range 
								to understand the consequences of climatic and anthropogenic pressures on deer demographic 
								and adaptive history. We found a strong signal of glacial-induced vicariance and demographic 
								decline; notably, there is a severe decline in white-tailed deer effective population size 
								(Ne) at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. We found robust evidence for a colonial impact 
								in the form of a recent and dramatic drop in Ne in all analysed populations. Historical 
								census size and restocking data show a clear parallel to historical Ne estimates, but temporal 
								Ne/Nc ratio shows patterns of conservation concern for mule deer. Signatures of selection 
								highlight genes related to temperature, including a cold receptor previously highlighted in 
								woolly mammoth. We also detected numerous immune-genes that we surmise reflect the changing 
								land-use patterns in North America. Our study provides a detailed picture of anthropogenic and 
								climatic-induced decline in deer diversity, and clues to understanding the conservation concerns 
								of mule deer and the successful demographic recovery of white-tailed deer.</p>

								<p>When a population is isolated and composed of few individuals, genetic drift is the paramount 
									evolutionary force. Inbreeding might also occur, resulting in genomic regions that are identical 
									by descent, manifesting as runs of homozygosity (ROHs) and the expression of recessive traits; 
									accordingly, ROH can be used to map phenotypic traits. Likewise, the genes underlying traits of 
									interest can be revealed by comparing fixed SNPs and divergent haplotypes between affected and 
									unaffected individuals. Populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on islands of 
									Saint Pierre and Miquelon (SPM, France) have high incidences of leucism and malocclusions; on 
									the Florida Keys islands (USA), deer exhibit smaller body sizes. Here we aimed to reconstruct 
									island demography and identify the genes associated with these traits using ROHs, fixed SNPs, 
									and divergent haplotypes as markers in a pseudo case-control design. The two island populations 
									of interest showed reduced levels of genomic diversity, a low Ne, and a build-up of genetic load 
									with significant divergence in Key deer. Key deer showed higher inbreeding levels, but not longer 
									ROHs, consistent with long-term isolation and a historical bottleneck. We identified multiple 
									trait-related genes in ROHs including LAMTOR2 which has links to hypopigmentation and HES1 which 
									is involved in the shortening of the maxilla and mandible. Our mixed approach of linking ROH, 
									fixed SNPs and haplotypes matched a high number (∼50) of a-priori body size candidate genes in 
									Key deer. All three phenotypes showed patterns consistent with a complex trait and non-mendelian 
									inheritance.</p>

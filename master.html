									up towards an ibex that is lying on the trail, the ibex is an older male with large, 
									magnificent horns and blue eartags. The ibex is lazily looking right at us. Next to him,
									on the left there is another ibex, probably a younger male with shorter horns, also looking at us. 
									Behind them, two other ibexes, one with his back at us and the other happily scratching his back with
									his horns." /></a>

				<p>Alpine ibex is an emblematic alpine species that was severely impacted by overhunting in the
					1800's to the point that there were only about 100 individuals left. Ironically, the species
					was saved because then King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, loved ibex hunting so much
					that he protected the species and provided a refuge in what is now the Gran Paradiso
					National Park. All existing populations, with a total of about 50,000 individuals, stem from this
					single refugial population. The bottleneck left distinct genomic traces, including one of particular
					concern: low genetic diversity at the MHC. The MHC is a region of the genome that codes for pathogen
					recognition proteins, the more diverse this region is, the more resistant an individual is to
					diseases.
					Low diversity at this region can therefore lad to higher disease susceptibility. Interestingly,
					in alpine ibex, some variation at the MHC was produced through introgression from domestic goat.</p>
				<p>This is where my Master's thesis comes into play. I carried it out at the Université de Neuchâtel in
					Switzerland under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Croll and in collaboration with Prof. Christine
					Grossen
					of the University of Zürich. The aim was to produce a sequencing assay to monitor the alpine ibex
					populations.
					For this, we designed and validated a microfluidic assay of about 1,000
					amplicons that can be used for easy and cost-effective population monitoring of alpine ibex. The
					assay
					simultaneously screens for population structure, immunogenetics and hybridisation with domestic
					goat, and
					perfoms well in comparison with RAD-seq and low coverage WGS data. With our assay, we were able to
					reconstruct
					the reintroduction history of alpine ibex with the Gran Paradiso population as the source of all
					other and each
					reintroduction represented a bottleneck event with a loss of genetic diversity. We were also able to
					confirm
					the identity of seven suspected hybrids, of which only three were actual hybrids. Finally, the
					analysis of
					immunity-related loci confirmed the low genetic diversity at the MHC previously observed in this
					species.

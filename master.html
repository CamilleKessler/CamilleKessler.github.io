									alt="Alpine ibex bloquing the hiking trail. There is a trail on the foreground that goes 
									up towards an ibex that is lying on the trail, the ibex is an older male with large, 
									magnificent horns and blue eartags. The ibex is lazily looking right at us. Next to him,
									on the left there is another ibex, probably a younger male with shorter horns, also looking at us. 
									Behind them, two other ibexes, one with his back at us and the other happily scratching his back with
									his horns."/></a>

								<p>Alpine ibex is an emblematic alpine species that was severely impacted by overhunting in the
									1800's to the point that there were only about 100 individuals left. Ironically, the species
									was saved because then King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II, loved ibex hunting so much
									that he protected the species and provided a refuge in what is now the Gran Paradiso
									National Park. All existing populations, with a total of about 50,000 individuals, stem from this 
									single refugial population. The bottleneck left distinct genomic traces, including one of particular
									concern: low genetic diversity at the MHC. The MHC is a region of the genome that codes for pathogen
									recognition proteins, the more diverse this region is, the more resistant an individual is to diseases.
									Low diversity at this region can therefore lad to higher disease susceptibility. Interestingly, 
									in alpine ibex, some variation at the MHC was produced through introgression from domestic goat.</p>
								<p>This is where my Master's thesis comes into play. I carried it out at the Université de Neuchâtel in 
									Switzerland under the supervision of Prof. Daniel Croll and in collaboration with Prof. Christine Grossen 
									of the University of Zürich. The aim was to produce a sequencing assay to monitor the alpine ibex populations. 
									For this, we designed and validated a microfluidic assay of about 1,000
									amplicons that can be used for easy and cost-effective population monitoring of alpine ibex. The assay
									simultaneously screens for population structure, immunogenetics and hybridisation with domestic goat, and
									perfoms well in comparison with RAD-seq and low coverage WGS data. With our assay, we were able to reconstruct
									the reintroduction history of alpine ibex with the Gran Paradiso population as the source of all other and each
									reintroduction represented a bottleneck event with a loss of genetic diversity. We were also able to confirm
									the identity of seven suspected hybrids, of which only three were actual hybrids. Finally, the analysis of
									immunity-related loci confirmed the low genetic diversity at the MHC previously observed in this species.
